    <h3>Music Visualization Video (Python)</h3>
    <p>
        This project involved creating a dynamic video that visualizes audio frequencies and beats in a creative way. Using Python, I processed audio data to generate visual effects synchronized with the music. The primary goal was to create an engaging visual experience that reflects the rhythm, tempo, and frequencies of the music in real-time. 
        I used libraries like Pygame and Matplotlib to generate the graphical visuals and synchronize them with the audio tracks. The project helped me hone my skills in both audio data processing and creative visual rendering.

            <h3>Custom Web Portfolio</h3>
            <p>
                Designed and developed a custom portfolio website to showcase my personal and professional projects. The project focused on creating an aesthetically pleasing, responsive web layout with an emphasis on user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design principles. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the website, while also employing tools like Adobe Photoshop for image creation and optimization. The goal was to present a user-friendly, mobile-optimized portfolio that could seamlessly adapt to various screen sizes.

            <h3>Elden Ring-Themed Snake Game (C#)</h3>
            <p>
                This project was a creative twist on the classic Snake game, incorporating an Elden Ring theme. Built with C# and Unity (optional if used), the game implemented object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to create smooth gameplay mechanics and an engaging user interface. The challenge was to seamlessly integrate the Elden Ring visual elements into the Snake gameplay, making it both visually interesting and true to the game's theme. 
                I focused on creating dynamic obstacles, power-ups, and scoring systems, all while ensuring the game mechanics were intuitive and fun.

            <h3>Hotel Reservation System (PHP)</h3>
            <p>
                Developed a hotel booking system using PHP and MySQL, which allows users to reserve rooms, view room availability in real time, and securely manage bookings. The system also included user authentication features for account creation, login, and reservation management. The primary objective was to design an intuitive interface and ensure the system was functional, secure, and scalable. I utilized both front-end (HTML/CSS) and back-end (PHP/MySQL) skills to implement real-time booking features and a secure login system.
